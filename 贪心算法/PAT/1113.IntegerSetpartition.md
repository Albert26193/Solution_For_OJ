## 题目描述：
Given a set of N (>1) positive integers, you are supposed to partition them into two disjoint sets A1 and A2 of n1 and n2 numbers, respectively. Let S1 and S2 denote the sums of all the numbers in A1 and A2, respectively. You are supposed to make the partition so that ∣n1 − n2∣ is minimized first, and then ∣S1−S2∣ is maximized.

Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives an integer N (2≤N≤10^5), and then N positive integers follow in the next line, separated by spaces. It is guaranteed that all the integers and their sum are less than 2^31. 

Output Specification:
For each case, print in a line two numbers: ∣n1​ −n2​ ∣ and ∣S1 −S2​​ ∣, separated by exactly one space.

Sample Input 1:
```
10
23 8 10 99 46 2333 46 1 666 555
```

Sample Output 1:
```
0 3611
```

Sample Input 2:
```
13
110 79 218 69 3721 100 29 135 2 6 13 5188 85
```

Sample Output 2:
```
1 9359
```

## 题目解答：
依然是贪心的思想，所有小的都放在前面，所有大的都放在后面，因为需要二者的长度之差最小，所以对于长度为偶数的情况，必然只有一种可能性。对于长度为奇数的情况，希望小者更小，大者更大，所以希望前面的长度小于后面的长度，依然只有一种情况。
